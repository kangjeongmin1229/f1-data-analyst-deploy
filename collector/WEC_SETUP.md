# WEC live-page discovery

This implementation follows the FIAWEC+ UI: sign in with the existing Render secret values, discover an event from `/en`, open the current year's live session card, activate its Live Timing link/button, follow the resulting page/popup/frame, and extract an observed timing URL and a recognisable timing table. It does not invent provider API endpoints or export authentication cookies, passwords, signed links, video or account-page contents.

## Verified and pending

On 2026-10-29 the developer browser successfully authenticated through FIAWEC+ → Staylive email → password → FIAWEC+. Monza's authenticated page contained 2023 replay cards but no current 2026 sessions. Barcelona's authenticated 2026 replay had no live-timing button. These are manual observations, **not proof that the new Render browser code has run successfully**.

Automated tests cover the navigation sequence through an injected driver, past/replay rejection, selection ambiguity, URL restrictions, private-link suppression, timing-table filtering, authenticated collector endpoints and deduplicated jobs. Actual session-time button labels, timing destination, provider session status and table schema still require verification. Until that verification, every result is `live: false`, including changing tables. Do not remove this gate solely because authentication or link discovery succeeds.

## Existing Render service

Target only `srv-dbehk51srm7s73c64h0g` (`hyprace-fastf1-collector`). Its runtime repository is `kangjeongmin1229/hyprace-fastf1-collector`, distinct from the canonical application repository. After review, mirror `cloud.py`, `wec_browser.py`, `wec_runtime.py`, `requirements-wec.txt`, `render-build.sh` and WEC tests from this directory, preserving the existing F1 files and secrets.

Use `bash render-build.sh` as the service build command. Keep `python cloud.py serve` as the start command. The build installs Playwright plus its matching Chromium headless shell and checks browser launch **before deployment**. If the native Render image lacks OS libraries, the build fails rather than breaking the F1 runtime; inspect this before deciding on a supported runtime change. No new service, paid plan, credential replacement or access-policy change is included.

Use existing `WEC_USERNAME` (or `WEC_EMAIL` / `FIAWEC_USERNAME`) and `WEC_PASSWORD` (or `FIAWEC_PASSWORD`) server environment variables. Never put their values in GitHub, a Site, a URL, logs or chat. Browser cookies stay in memory and are destroyed when the bounded job exits. F1 credentials and `COLLECTOR_READ_KEY` stay unchanged.

## Requests and results

- Authenticated `POST /wec/discover`: JSON `{ "event": "Monza", "year": 2026, "session": "FP1" }`. Allowed sessions: auto, FP1, FP2, FP3, Qualifying, Hyperpole, Race. Event is an English name fragment, not a URL.
- Authenticated `GET /wec/snapshot`: last safe result; does not log in or start a job.
- Shared MCP tools `wec_discover_live` and `wec_live_status` use the existing collector URL/key. The WEC page offers separate start/status buttons. Existing visitor authentication is preserved.
- One job at a time, 110-second execution deadline, 60-second duplicate-request suppression. No repository polling or new scheduled automation. Authentication/MFA/CAPTCHA/subscription failures stop further sign-in attempts until operator intervention/restart. Human verification is never bypassed.
- Public result stages distinguish waiting, authentication, missing browser runtime, missing timing link, unapproved destination, unsupported table and unverified snapshot. Signed timing links are withheld, not altered into broken public links; the safe session page remains the user entrypoint.

## Session-time acceptance

At an actual FP1/FP2/FP3/qualifying/hyperpole/race session, verify the card's current year/event/session and live badge, capture the actual timing control and final approved host, confirm the session identity/status from the provider, and observe increasing current feed timestamps. Only then implement/enable the exact provider-specific `live` check. A stale replay, generic page clock, login success, or nonempty table is insufficient. If a new timing host is observed, review it explicitly before adding it to the narrowly scoped allowlist.

Deployment of this branch and the Render mirror is not implied by these instructions. Check their actual commit/deploy status separately.

## Existing Render commands (2026-10-29)

The existing `pip install -r requirements.txt` build command now includes pinned Playwright. `python cloud.py serve` explicitly prepares the matching Chromium headless shell once when missing and verifies launch before serving traffic. It does not authenticate to FIAWEC+ during setup. A 300-second download limit and 30-second launch limit fail the new rollout on error; no system packages, access policies or secrets are changed. The existing optional `bash render-build.sh` can still preinstall it at build time. `/healthz` exposes only browser readiness and Render source SHA, never account credentials. Actual live-session reception remains separately unverified.

## Scheduled reader and personal logins (2026-11-06)

- Flow (owner's recorded browser skill): FIA WEC home `https://plus.fiawec.com/` → NEXT SESSIONS card with LIVE (or the scheduled session's card) → session page → LIVE TIMING → `https://plus.fiawec.com/en/livestream/s-<event>-<session>-<id>`. Before the start the page shows a "TO START" countdown and "Syncing live timeline" (state `timing_waiting_start`, not an error). ELMS cards are filtered by the event name.
- Crew: `.github/workflows/wec-live-collector.yml` runs every 30 minutes, finds a WEC session window in `/api/race-calendar` (start −10 min to end +15 min; back-to-back qualifying/hyperpole sessions merge), signs in with repository secrets `WEC_USERNAME`/`WEC_PASSWORD`, keeps the livestream page open and pushes the timing table to `/api/wec/actions-push` (GitHub OIDC, this workflow only). No AWS or home host. A 6-hour race exceeds one job, so the next scheduled run continues the same window.
- `live=true` only while the window is open and the table changed within 90 seconds. Login/CAPTCHA/subscription problems stop the run without retrying.
- Others: `/live` → "내 FIAWEC+ 계정 연결" → collector `/personal/<account>/wec/login` (`PersonalWEC` in wec_runtime.py; in-memory credentials, 8 hours, max `PERSONAL_WEC_MAX_SESSIONS`=2, never the owner's account).
- Still to verify at a real session: the timing table selector on the livestream page. If `timing_layout_unverified` appears while the page is running, adjust `read_rows` to the observed layout.

## FIAWEC+ 연결 (saved sign-in, 2026-11-06)

Owner decision: a person signs in to FIAWEC+ once and the sign-in is kept, so sessions do not log in again (each fresh login met a CAPTCHA). Nothing here solves a CAPTCHA or types a password.

- Account settings → **FIAWEC+ 연결** opens a remote view of a collector browser (`wec_signin.py`, routes `/wec/signin/<account>/<start|frame|input|cancel>`). The person taps and types through screenshots, solves any CAPTCHA, and the browser's storage state goes back to the site once the FIAWEC+ account menu appears.
- The site stores it AES-GCM encrypted per account (`wec/auth/<account>.json`, key from `WEC_AUTH_KEY` or `FASTF1_CLOUD_KEY`), never returns it to a browser or MCP tool, and deletes it on "연결 해제".
- The owner's connection is `operator`. Crew never connect; the scheduled reader (`wec_live_runner.py`) fetches it via `/api/wec/actions-auth` (workflow OIDC) and posts refreshed cookies back after each session. The WEC_USERNAME/WEC_PASSWORD secrets are only a fallback.
- Personal accounts: the site hands the saved state to `/personal/<account>/wec/restore` whenever the collector has forgotten it.
- A blocked or expired sign-in (`sign_in_expired`, CAPTCHA, login required) marks the connection `needs_reconnect` and sends one web push to the Google account that connected it (enable alerts at /alerts). The reader starts 10 minutes before each session, so the alert usually comes before the green flag.
- How long FIAWEC+ keeps a sign-in valid, and whether cookies made on one server keep working on GitHub Actions runners, is not verified yet.
