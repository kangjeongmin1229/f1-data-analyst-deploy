# Timing71 archive — reader, collector, checks

Source: Timing71 replay archive (`archive.timing71.org`, files on Backblaze). Timing data belongs to each
series' timing provider; Timing71 publishes no data terms. **Calibration use only**: raw files and
per-series summaries stay in the GitHub Actions cache; this repo commits only counts, checks and fit
results. Credit: "Timing71 archive".

## Files

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `scripts/sim/t71-read.mjs` | Replay ZIP → one row per completed lap (lap, time, all sector columns, tyre, tyre age, VFT, speed trap, class, driver, flag, pit) + frame weather + end flag. Own dictdiffer patcher (no AGPL code imported). |
| `scripts/sim/t71-collect.mjs` | Lists the archive, picks qualifying + race sessions (2018+) of the series below, reads them in 8 shards, writes a compact per-car summary. |
| `scripts/sim/t71-tracks.mjs` | Session name → track id (keyword table + "nearby session" rule). |
| `scripts/sim/t71-check.mjs` | Three-way check vs the calibration references (TI/OpenF1 for F1, Al Kamel for WEC). |
| `scripts/sim/gate.mjs` | Held-out gate used by every fit (see below). |
| `scripts/sim/wec-tyre-fit.mjs` | WEC compound effect from race stints (K3). |
| `.github/workflows/lapsim-t71.yml` | Collect → merge → check → fit; commits only small outputs. |

## Reader checks (22 real sessions, 11 series)

- Frame lap *n* = analysis-file lapNumber *n + 1* (same offset on every series).
- Lap times equal to the analysis file on 99.9%+ of laps in 19 sessions. F1 qualifying replays are
  partly incomplete (107/204 laps in one sample); F1 is cross-check only.
- Sector sum = lap time (±0.002 s) on ≥95% of laps where all sectors exist.
- Nürburgring feeds have no analysis file (frames only), 9 sectors, and "track data" = slow zones, not weather.
- Some feeds (ALMS, VLN) have no `Laps` column: a lap is counted when `Last` changes.

## Collection (run 3)

1,845 sessions, 0 failures. Per series (Q / R): F1 172/156, WEC 129/65, IMSA 111/146, FE 245/151,
GTWC 86/93, IGTC 35/23, DTM 29/31, Nürburgring 25/47, Macau 34/28, ELMS 106/55, ALMS 38/40.
About 150 sessions hold no laps (short partial recordings of 5–50 min, split feeds).

**Replays are often incomplete.** Share that reached the chequered flag: WEC Q 101/129, IMSA Q 79/111,
F1 Q 107/172, FE Q 105/245, GTWC Q 52/86 (Nürburgring feeds have no chequered flag state). A qualifying
best is used as a pole reference only when the replay reached the chequered flag.

## Track ids

1,785 / 1,845 sessions mapped. Not mapped (listed, not guessed): 57 GTWC Europe 2018–19 sessions named
only "Round N", 3 sessions of IMSA "Motul 100% Synthetic Grand Prix" 2020.

## Three-way check (TI / OpenF1 · Al Kamel · Timing71), 108 reference laps

| Result | Rows |
|---|---|
| Same lap (±0.0015 s), sectors identical | 59 |
| Timing71 slower: reference lap not recorded (Hyperpole / Q3 missing, partial replay) | 26 |
| **Timing71 faster (real conflict)** | **0** |
| Event not in the archive | 23 |

Weather on the same sessions: air and track temperature within about 1 °C of the references.

## Tyre field

Timing71 tyre cells are `[letters, colour label]`. Letters (S/M/H/W, one per corner on a mixed set, e.g.
`SMSM`) match the known WEC allocations (`wec-tyres-data.js`) on 549/549 best laps; the colour label is
wrong on 44/523 (e.g. Fuji 2026 "hard" when only soft/medium were supplied). The letters are used.

## Gate (applies to every fit)

A new model is kept only if its held-out error (leave-one-event/track-out or unseen season) is lower
than the current model's on the same rows, beyond one standard error of the paired squared-error gain,
with at least 5 rows. Otherwise the current model stays and the result is written here as rejected.
The test can be applied per group (series, class, track) so a model is used only where it helps.

## K3 — WEC compound effect: rejected

Method: race stints 2024+ with ≥5 green laps; stint best green lap as % of the race trend (Theil–Sen line
over stint start time, removes track evolution and fuel); car mean removed; residual = k × tyre score
(S 0, M 1, H 2, mean over corners). Leave one event out. Variants declared before testing.

| Variant | Rows | Events | k (%/step) | LOO RMS no effect | LOO RMS model | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hypercar, same car | 643 | 6 | 0.163 | 1.406% | 1.444% | rejected (worse) |
| Hypercar, same car + driver | 550 | 6 | 0.189 | 1.495% | 2.035% | rejected (worse) |
| LMGT3 | 0 | 0 | — | — | — | no car ran two compounds in one race |

Stint-to-stint noise (~1.4%) is far larger than any compound step. The page keeps
"not measured, lap unchanged". No further variants were tried (that would tune on the test set).
